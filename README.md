## Project Proposal
### Design Brief
### Book Choice and Justification
The book I have chosen is the first novel in *The Giver* quartet by Lois Lowry called "The Giver". It is about:     

Jonas's world is perfect. Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain. There are no choices. Every person is assigned a role in the Community. When Jonas turns twelve, he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver. The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life. Now it's time for Jonas to receive the truth. There is no turning back.

I chose this book because it is a fast-paced novel with a deep storyline as it is set in a crumbling utopian society. This book inspired my project...
